title: How to become a data scientist?
---

This is my first blog on data science and other tech stuff. Basically, I will write down what I have learned along the way and share it with the community. In this first blog, I will say something about my transition from academia to IT industry. Hopefully, it will be helpful for other guys with similar background.  

I was a mathematician working on mathematical physics. Basically, a mathematician suddenly finds an interesting problem, does a lot of calculations, and then proves beautiful theorems, finally publishes nice papers. More importantly, you have to sell your theory by giving presentations and applying for fundings, it is a hard career.
