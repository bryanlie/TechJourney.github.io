### More Information

“By definition all scientists are data scientists. In my opinion, they are half hacker, half analyst, they use data to build products and find insights. It’s Columbus meet Columbo -- starry-eyed explorers and skeptical detectives.” <br/>
-- Monica Rogati, Independent Data Science Advisor
